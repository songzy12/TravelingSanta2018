1. non-sequential moves (especially 4-opt) are super important and make difference between 15152xx and 1514xxx teritory
2. do not optimize 10% right after LKH, but first optimize using lower penalty. In the end our schedule was like 1%, 2%, .., 9%, 10%.
3. after escaping local minima with kick and optimizing do not just compare result with best, but merge it with best (replace segments in best).

1. Get pure TSP with LKH. Score 1516321.
2. Run penalty aware steepest descent Lin-Kerninghan. Score 1514683.
3. Try applying higher opts. Score 1514610, but it was helpful after kick sessions too.
4. Kick tour, reoptimize. Score 1514245.
5. Kick tour, reoptimize with tricks from 3, recombine with GPX2. Score 1514014.

1. LKH: We used LKH to get the raw tour of 1502600 (prime score 1516256) as the starting step.
2. 2.5-opt and 3-opt (just 1 type of sequential 3-opt with no flipped segment) got us to 15158xx.
3. Double bridge (one type of 4-opt non-sequential moves with no flipped segment) helped us to improve to 15156xx.
4. We discovered the gradually penalty increasing trick (the same as the 2nd place team). This helped us to decrease to 15154xx.
5. To this stage, every computation is slow. Then we discover a major breakthrough: THE CUMSUM TRICK to deal with prime scoring function. We got 200x faster?!!!. We don't need any GPU, or even numpy package. With pure python, we can straightly optimize from 1516256 to 15149xx in just under 1 hour (use pypy3 instead of python)! Using this trick, we were able to get to 15149xx.
6. Then we used "kicks", which is the same as "break and fix" that was discussed in the forum a few days ago, to escape local minima. Kicking with short segments by all types of our moves (from 5-opt to 2.5-opt), then quickly reoptimizing by all types of moves , by a diverse set of parameters, got us to 15147xx. We coded the 5-opt moves by LK heuristics, and running with cumsum trick. So 5-opt is implemented effectively! Please note that ALL types of k-opt (k<=5), both sequential and non-sequential, can be implemented.
7. When kicking with k-opt moves exhaused, we tried to kick by using the EAX algorithm (combining 2 different tours). This slightly improved our score to the lower end of 15147xx.
8. Then we use shuffling cities on segments up to 200 cities, using lower bound estimation. This hugely boost our score to 15145xx.
9. Finally, all four of us collaborate on the final push by using the shared Dropbox folder, and kicking that 15145xx tour restlessly in days. Whenever who found a new tour, it would be put immediately onto that shared folder, and the other members automatically get that tour and continue to kick. This simple method is extremely efficient, since we can exploit all of our computation resources. Our final score is 1514438.
